## The Algorithm

The algorithm takes a large dataset of images of birds and drones as well as the sky in order to train the jetson nano to dectect brids and drones in the sky. Then is it tested using an image that has not been part of the dataset, to check its accuracy. 

## Running this project

1. Connect PuTTY to your computer and VSCode using SSH with your IP. 
2. Download jetson inference using github with link:
